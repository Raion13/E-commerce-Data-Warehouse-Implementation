- Background
As a Data Engineer at ID/X Partners, I have been assigned a project for a client in the e-commerce industry. The client's requirement is to build a Data Warehouse that consolidates data from various tables in their source database. The Data Warehouse will consist of a Fact table and several Dimension tables. The objective is to provide the client with a centralized and optimized data repository for analysis and reporting purposes.

The client needs a robust Data Warehouse solution to effectively analyze their e-commerce data. They want to streamline reporting, gain insights, and make data-driven decisions. The project involves importing the data into a staging environment, creating the Data Warehouse schema, implementing ETL processes, and developing a stored procedure for generating summary sales order reports based on delivery status.

- Objective
The objective of this project is to successfully implement a Data Warehouse solution for the e-commerce client, enabling efficient data analysis and reporting. The Data Warehouse should accurately reflect the business processes and support the client's decision-making needs.
